# Bluetooth Audio Signal Processing

This project focuses on real-time audio signal processing using Bluetooth technology. It's designed for ESP applications where audio data from a microphone is captured, analyzed, and displayed based on Bluetooth connectivity.

## Overview

The main components of this project include:

- Microphone Data Capture
- Signal Velocity Modification
- Signal Presence Detection
- Frequency Analysis
- Bluetooth Connectivity

## Usage

1. Ensure you have the required hardware components set up.
2. Flash the firmware to your ESP device.
3. Connect your device to a Bluetooth source.
4. The program will continuously perform signal processing and display results in a display.

## Configuration

You can customize the signal processing parameters by modifying the defined constants in the code.
